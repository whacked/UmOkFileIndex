* UmOkFileIndex

  a simple-minded tool to tag files (images really) and search them reasonably quickly
  
  If you have lots of pdf or don't need image support, check out =calibre=, =docfetcher=, =recoll=

  But, I have a bunch of images scanned from old documents that are loosely organized in folders. They rarely change and are rarely accessed, but a lot have text. I just want a simple interface to join file paths to tags.

* Y U NO EXIST!

  Looked around, didn't find, so... Um Ok

* PyQt app (main.py)

  [[./screenshot.png]]

** dependencies

   PyQt4, sqlalchemy, sqlite. That *should* be it. I'm running python 2.7

** running

   put the files somewhere and launch with =python main.py /PATH/TO/YOUR/ARCHIVE/DIRECTORY=

   =/PATH/TO/YOUR/ARCHIVE/DIRECTORY= will be the =ROOT PATH=, and file names will be stored relative to that root.

   On first run, it will index the files in the directory. Files are initially tagged with parts derived from the filenames and relative file paths, and the extension.

   When the program starts, nothing will show up. Enter something in the search bar, say, "jpg". TOFIX *realtime is really slow*
   
** tagging

   Click on a file, tags show up below. Tags are comma-separated and all lowercase. Any non-lowercase input will be downcased.

   Add/delete tags and click the =apply changes= button

*** multiple tagging

    click-drag, shift-click, or ctrl-click to select multiple entries. The tag listing will be narrowed down to tags shared between those entries.

    Deleting or adding tags here, and clicking apply, will apply all tag additions and deletions to all selected files
    
** checksum...

   For archive integrity, you should use =hashdeep= instead

* command line app (Indexer.py)

  =python Indexer.py --help=

* TOFIX

** DONE realtime search slow for non-toy-sized indexes
   CLOSED: [2013-11-03 Sun 14:09]

   prelim fixed with using custom data model + tableview. should create another todo if still slow.

** TODO change to pyfs?

** TODO change index.db location behavior

** TODO test utf8, probably bork somewhere

** TODO reorganize this
